# People-API-with-Spring-Boot
<h2>Digital Innovation One: Project to Bootcamp - Developing a people management system on REST API with Spring Boot</h2>


In this project a small system for managing people in a company was developed through a REST API, created with Spring Boot. The initial project setup was generated with Spring Boot Initialzr. Next, we create a data model for mapping entities into database. Then we developed some user management operations (Registering, reading, updating, and removing people from a system). All relationships for each of these operations were developed based on the REST architectural pattern. Some unit tests were also developed to validate the functionalities. The project was deployed on the cloud system via Heroku.
